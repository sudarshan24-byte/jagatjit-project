There are 3 folders
├── src
│   ├── components
│   ├── pages
│   ├── utils

-> components - Here all the reusable components will be there.
-> pages - Here we will write code for Web Pages and use the reusable components from the components folder.
-> utils - utils folder is for frontend backend integration.

Example:
├── src
│   ├── components
│   │   ├── Home
            ├── Heading.jsx

This is a reusable component. Import it in pages file and just pass the 'name' prop.

- Same structure will be followed for public folder. Add Images in the public folder based on the web pages.
  Like :- Home page images will be in:
  ├── public
      ├── Home-Images

   The images which will be using in all pages mention it in:
   ├── public
       ├── xyz.png
    Example: logo.png

- In the tailwind.config.js file 2 colors have been added and 1 font (From the figma colors scheme), use that colors (If color scheme is changed then update in that file, it will reflect to whole project.)

- WHENEVER NEW CODE IS BEING ADDED/UPDATED MENTION IT IN THE PROJECT.TXT FILE.
